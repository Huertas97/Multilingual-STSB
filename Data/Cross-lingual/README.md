# Cross-lingual datasets

As mentioned in the paper we have combined the pair-sentences from different languages to create new cross-lingual tasks apart from the monolingual tasks. There are different cross-lingual datasets verison. The number of tasks increase from v1 to v3. 

### Data fields


### Versions explanations
All these versions include the 15 monolingual tasks (e.g., en;en, es;es, de;de).  
* Version 1 (v1): Multilingual STS Benchmark test split with  31 - 15 = 16 crosslingual tasks. Cross-lingual tasks have always English as first language (i.e., EN;lang)
* Version 2 (v2): Multilingual STS Benchmark test split with  45 - 15 = 30 crosslingual tasks. This v2 is composed of monolingual, EN;lang and lang;EN tasks. 
* Version 3 (v3): Multilingual STS Benchmark test split with  120 - 15 = 105 crosslingual tasks. This v3 is composed of all the possible combination between languages (lang;lang).
