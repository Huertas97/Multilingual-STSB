# Multilingual-STSB

The original STS Benchmark [[1]](#1) consists of train-dev-test splits of 5749, 1500, and 1379 pairs of sentences, respectively, labelled with a similarity score between 0 and 5, from less to more similar. To extend the original English STSb to a multilingual dataset, we translate the STS Benchmark splits from English to 15 languages<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. The [Google Translator python package](https://pypi.org/project/google-trans-new/}{https://pypi.org/project/google-trans-new/) is used for this purpose, following the same  procedure that has been largely used in existing related literature [[2]](#2) [[3]](#3) [[4]](#4). In addition, to maintain data quality, translated sentence pairs with a confidence value below 0.7 were dropped. As a result, Dutch is the language with the lowest sentence pairs in development (1483 sentence pairs) and test (1358 sentence pairs) sets. Besides, Google Translator distinguishes two variants of Chinese: simplified and using Mainland Chinese terms (<i>zh-CN</i>), and traditional and using Taiwanese terms (<i>zh-TW</i>).

# Data

The data is splitted into train, dev and test sets at "Data" folder in pickle files. You can easily load the data using `read_pickle()` function from `pandas`.
